## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-07

### Added
- **Complete system rewrite** with production-ready architecture
- **RAG Implementation**: FAISS-powered similarity search with Delta Lake integration
- **Multi-Agent System**: LangChain-based agents with tool-calling capabilities
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure OAuth2 token-based authentication with bcrypt
- **Circuit Breaker Resilience**: Automatic failure handling for external services
- **Prometheus Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics collection and alerting
- **Async Performance**: Non-blocking processing with advanced caching
- **Rate Limiting**: Global and per-user request throttling
- **Input Validation**: Profanity filtering, financial validation, and sanitization
- **Testing Suite**: Unit and integration tests with pytest
- **Docker Deployment**: Containerized deployment with docker-compose
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README, API docs, and architecture guide

### Changed
- Migrated from basic API key auth to JWT tokens
- Enhanced error handling with custom exceptions and circuit breakers
- Improved caching from simple TTL to multi-level (memory + Redis)
- Upgraded from synchronous to async processing
- Added comprehensive input validation and security measures

### Technical Improvements
- **RAG Enhancements**: L2 normalization, data validation, FAISS optimization
- **LangChain Integration**: Proper BaseTool implementations and agent configuration
- **Performance**: Async I/O, thread pools, connection pooling
- **Security**: Multi-layer validation, rate limiting, content filtering
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics, health checks, logging improvements
- **Deployment**: Docker security hardening, orchestration scripts

### Fixed

- Authentication flow with secure token management
- External service integration with retry mechanisms
- Input validation edge cases and security vulnerabilities

### Security
- Implemented JWT authentication with secure token handling
- Added input sanitization and content filtering
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Container security with non-root user and minimal attack surface
- Secrets management with environment variables

## [0.1.0] - Initial Development
